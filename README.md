## Hello!

I'm fascinated by studying and exploring Machine Learning in every possible way, mainly Natural Language Processing (NLP). \
In my final year of master's studies in Data Science and Business Analytics.

Some of my projects:
* [Neural Network Performance Comparison](https://github.com/szymonsocha/ml-deep-learning-neural-network)
* [Traffic Prediction](https://github.com/szymonsocha/ml-regression-random-forest)
* [Option Pricing Rcpp Package](https://github.com/szymonsocha/monte-carlo-option-pricing)
